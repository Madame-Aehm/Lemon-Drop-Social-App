Project for **Code Academy Berlin**.

This project is the product of my second module at Code Academy Berlin. The goal is to use the popular MERN stack to create a social app where users can create and interact with content within the app. I chose drink recipes to be the theme of my API. A visitor can view recipes and the profiles of the users that posted them, but cannot interact with the app further. Users who have created an account can post and edit recipes, comment on recipes of other users, favourite recipes of other users and view them in their profile, and edit their own account details through the profile page.

The MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React and Node.js) makes up the base of this project. Mongoose provides structure with schemas/models, Cloudinary hosts the images, and JWs tokens provide authentication, along with other middleware such as Multer, Passport, Bycrypt and CORS.

Most styled elements are imported the React-Bootstrap library.
